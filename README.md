## Branch and Merge

A game built with HTML5 / jQuery where you alternate between **branching** and **merging**.

You can play it [here](http://projects.dicksontse.com/game-off/).

## Instructions

Change your direction using the WASD/Arrow keys.

You initially **branch** by touching a green tile and then **merge** afterwards by touching a red tile. Repeating this process will gradually increase your movement speed.

Failure to alternate between branching and merging will result in a game over. Hitting a wall also results in a game over.
